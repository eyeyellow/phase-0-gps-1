**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was previously struggling with what it means to 'fetch' something on GitHub. Additionally, I was not entirely sure what a merge conflict was.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I feel that the GPS clarified both of these concepts - either through my partner and me talking through the problems, or when we deferred to the guide a couple times to ask him to define the terms for us.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked the guide what were the best practices for leaving commit messages - specifically which grammatical tense they had to be in. I asked the guide a few times to clarify what she was doing so that we could both be on the same page.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I am still confused by getting the occasional message: 'fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge.' I commit the files using separate commands, and it often works, and I see my changes after the commit - so, I'm not sure what the issue is. I am also not entirely sure what 'fast-forwards' are, even though I was able to Google things and get through things.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great. I genuinely felt that it gave me an opportunity to develop my skills and knowledge.
